# basic-audio-recognition
A basic program to recognise and differntiate between different voice inputs using differential pitch analysis. 
we record "Hello" three times and analyse and store the average pitch of the user. 
by checking the difference between this pitch and the test audio pitch we can identify the user among a set of voices with a small margin of error.
